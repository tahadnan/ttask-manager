# TaskManager

TaskManager is a simple Python package for managing tasks. It's designed to be used in command-line interface (CLI) applications, providing basic task management functionality.

## Description

This package was created as part of a learning project to understand Python package development and distribution. While it's not intended to be a comprehensive task management solution, it serves as a practical example of how to structure and package a Python project.

The TaskManager package provides functionality to:
- Add tasks to a to-do list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Remove tasks from the list
- View current tasks and completed tasks

## What's New in 0.2.2 Release

In this release, we fixed a bug related to how the `save_current_state` method saves the `data.json` file. Previously, the file was saved in the directory where the script was **executed** from, which could lead to unexpected file locations. Now, the `data.json` file is saved in the directory where the script being **executed** is located, ensuring data is stored in the same directory as the executing script.

Additionally, the `load_recent_state` method has been updated to load the `data.json` file from the same directory where the executed script is located, ensuring consistency between saving and loading operations.


## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the TaskManager effectively:

```python
from ttask_manager.ttask_manager import TaskManager

# Create a new TaskManager instance
tm = TaskManager()

# Load existing tasks (if any)
tm.load_recent_state()

# Add multiple tasks to the to-do list
tm.add_task("Write README", "Create setup.py", "Push to GitHub", "Test the application")

# View current to-do tasks
print(tm.current_state('to-do'))

# Mark specific tasks as done
tm.task_done("Write README", "Test the application")

# View completed tasks
print(tm.current_state('done'))

# Generate a report of today's tasks
print(tm.report())

# Clear the to-do list after completing tasks
tm.clear_todo_list()

# Reset both lists if needed
tm.reset()
```

This example showcases how to create a TaskManager instance, load existing tasks, manage to-do and completed tasks, generate a daily report, and reset the lists as needed.

## Features

- Add multiple tasks at once
- Remove tasks from the to-do list
- Mark tasks as completed
- View current to-do list and completed tasks
- Clear to-do or completed lists
- Reset both lists

## Development
This project was primarily created as a learning exercise in Python package development. Its simplicity is intentional, and there are no plans for significant feature additions or expansions. However, if you find a bug or have a suggestion for a minor improvement, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Notice

Due to the pressure of my studies, I will be taking a pause from further development on the TaskManager. Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.
